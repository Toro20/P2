# Travel and Tours
This is a mock travel website for a hotel created using Java, Angular, and Typescript.
There is multithreaded language translation for both English and French, along with conversions for the US Dollars, Canadian Dollars, and British Pounds.
Each price is based on the room the user selects along with the dates the user wishes to stay at the hotel. Time conversions are also done for users based on their region, should they wish to attend events.
This was then used as a Docker Image and pushed to Azure.
